                                    Best Photography Tips For Beginners
                                </h3>
                                <p class = "blog-text">
                                    1. Make sure you have quality equipment.
It's hard to take high-quality shots if your gear isn't up to snuff. Get a camera that provides plenty of customization options. Make sure your camera accessories can stand up to the elements, and that any portable lighting is sturdy. Buy specialized lenses if you want unusual photographs, such as waterproof lenses for underwater shots. Think about what photo effects might improve images, then find the equipment and software programs that make them possible.
2. Pick your focal point.
Ask yourself what your photo subject is and then focus on it. Make sure your camera keeps your subject in focus as well. Get close to your subject if you can, especially if it's a person. Move in until it fills the frame. Certain digital cameras and smartphone cameras help with this by locking onto the subject. Then you can blur the background or reduce camera shake to maintain a clear, sharp view.
3. Learn the rule of thirds.
The rule of thirds states you should divide your shot into three equal parts both vertically and horizontally. Then, place your subject or more important details off-center, leaving the other two-thirds open. This makes for an interesting photograph and helps draw the viewer's eye into the whole composition rather than just the center. It can also help to highlight an unusual background and convey more of a feeling of motion than a centered image. Many digital cameras and cameras on cell phones have a setting that helps you with this by displaying a grid over your view.
4. Change your angles.
Don't be afraid to move around rather than shooting your subject head on. You can often produce interesting perspectives this way. Create good depth of field or quirky moods by taking pictures from high, low or skewed angles. If you have trouble getting the angle you want, a stationary or opposable camera tripod may help.

                                    How to Work With Outdoor Lighting Conditions
                                  When you’re shooting outside, there’s usually only one light source: the sun. Working with natural light is going to be one of your biggest assets, but also your biggest challenge.

                                    Unlike indoor or portrait photography, you’ll have little control over the intensity and direction of light.
                                    Shooting during midday tends to create harsh shadows and washed-out highlights, which will cause you to lose a lot of details. If you do find yourself shooting with the sun, at least make sure that it’s behind you so that it’s illuminating your scene rather than overwhelming it.
                                    The best times to shoot with natural light are in the early morning and evening when the light is softer and more diffuse. If you want to take advantage of the golden hour, you’ll need to be on-location and set up at least an hour before sunrise (or after sunset).

                                    Best Photography Tips For Wedding Photography
                                </h3>
                                <p class = "blog-text">
                                    1. Know your gear. Familiarize yourself with all aspects of your camera gear, including your lenses, camera settings, and shooting modes. For example, a fast shutter speed is great for capturing fun party moments at the wedding reception, whereas a long shutter speed works best for still, pre-wedding portraits. A wide-angle lens is great for group shots, but a prime lens (lenses with a fixed focal length) is a better option for that high-resolution shot of the wedding couple at the altar. Understanding the best settings and lenses for each shot allows you to capture the best quality images you can when shooting weddings. Test out your gear beforehand to ensure everything is in working order.
                                 2. Bring help. Consider bringing a second photographer along who can simultaneously capture alternative angles of your shots. You can also task your fellow photographer with capturing all the smaller, candid moments, giving you enough time to shoot the significant, emotional events. Bringing a second shooter will provide you with a wider range of photo options to choose from during post-processing.3. Prepare. Weddings can be stressful and unpredictable—you should prepare yourself for all possibilities. Whether it’s bringing extra batteries and memory cards, or finding additional locations to shoot the fun wedding party photos, have a backup plan and be ready to shift gears if necessary. Your preparedness can potentially save the day and inform how to handle similar issues at your next wedding.
                                4. Know who you’re shooting. The wedding day is about the couple and the friends and family who are gathering to celebrate their nuptials. Request a list of attendees or the seating arrangements to familiarize yourself with all of the guests that you need to photograph for the wedding album.
                                5. Be familiar with the locations. Visit the venue before the wedding to see the layout and lighting opportunities. If you’re shooting the wedding party at a separate location, visit it before the shoot. Seeing the space beforehand will help you prepare for any potential obstacles (like poor lighting or an obstructive landscape) you may face on the day of the actual wedding.
